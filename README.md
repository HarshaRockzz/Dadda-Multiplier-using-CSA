# Dadda-Multiplier-using-CSA

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Dadda Multiplier using Carry Save Adder (CSA) technique. The Dadda multiplier is an efficient hardware multiplier architecture that minimizes the number of addition stages required for multiplication, improving speed and reducing area.

## Features
- Implementation of Dadda Multiplier
- Utilization of Carry Save Adder (CSA) for efficient addition
- Detailed circuit design and simulation
- Verification of functionality through testbenches

## Technologies
- Verilog/VHDL
- Cadence Virtuoso (or any other EDA tool used for design and simulation)
- ModelSim/QuestaSim (or any other simulation tool)

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- EDA tools such as Cadence Virtuoso, ModelSim, etc.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HarshaRockzz/Dadda-Multiplier-using-CSA.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Dadda-Multiplier-using-CSA
    ```
3. Open the design files in your preferred EDA tool.
4. Compile the design and testbench files.
5. Run the simulations to verify the functionality of the Dadda Multiplier.
